# Chenguang Duan

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Wuhan University, working under the guidance of Prof. Jerry Zhijian Yang and Prof. Yuling Jiao. I completed my Bachelor's degree in mathematics at Wuhan University as well.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computational mathematics, statistics, and machine learning, with a particular focus on learning theory and scientific machine learning.
